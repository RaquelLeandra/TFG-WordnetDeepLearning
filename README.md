### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are representation learning techniques that achieve state-of-the-art
performance on almost every image-related, machine learning task. Applying the representation languages
build by these models to tasks beyond the one they were originally trained for is a field of interest known as
transfer learning for feature extraction. In this work we will study a Full-Network Embedding made ussing
transfer learning from a deep convolutional neural network trained for image classification ussing the dataset
of Imagenet and it’s rellation with different synsets of Wordnet.
